PASSWORD STRENGTH CHECKER
The Password Strength Checker project aims to develop a tool that evaluates the strength of a given password based on specific criteria, providing users with feedback on how to improve their password security.

Key Features:

1. Password Strength Evaluation: The tool assesses the password strength based on factors such as length, complexity, and character diversity.
2. Criteria-based Evaluation: The tool checks for criteria such as:
    - Minimum length (e.g., 8 characters)
    - Uppercase letters
    - Lowercase letters
    - Digits
    - Special characters
3. Strength Meter: The tool provides a strength meter that categorizes the password as:
    - Weak
    - Medium
    - Strong
4. Feedback and Suggestions: The tool provides feedback and suggestions to users on how to improve their password strength.

Benefits:

1. Improved Password Security: The tool helps users create stronger passwords, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to their accounts.
2. Enhanced User Experience: The tool provides users with clear feedback and suggestions, empowering them to take control of their password security.
3. Reduced Risk of Data Breaches: By promoting strong password practices, the tool helps reduce the risk of data breaches and cyber attacks.

Target Audience:

1. Individual Users: The tool is designed for individual users who want to improve their password security and protect their online accounts.
2. Organizations: The tool can also be used by organizations to promote strong password practices among their employees and customers.

Technical Requirements:

1. Programming Language: The tool can be developed using programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, or Java.
2. Regular Expressions: The tool uses regular expressions to check for specific patterns and criteria in the password.
3. User Interface: The tool can be designed with a user-friendly interface to provide clear feedback and suggestions to users.
